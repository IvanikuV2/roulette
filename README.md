# roulette
#### Easy to use OSS cross-platform software equivalent of the russian roulette written in rustlang

Have you ever woken up one day with the immense urge to put your whole system at risk for some unexplainable reason? Well you're in luck! Roulette has got you covered.

If you're in a unix-like system, just run the program with sudo or doas, heck you can even just use good ol' su. If you're a Windows user just run it as administrator and let the "fun" begin! My friend Deception (who is trapped inside this crappy piece of software) will roll a six faced dice for you, and if it lands on a 6, he will delete your essential system libraries and binaries!

Feel free to play this fun game with your friends, family and colleagues. With amazingly fun and family friendly games like "Who will lose their fucking PC first?" or "Who's gonna lose the memories they have made for over the years in just one fraction of a second?". The possibilities are almost limitless!
